Hello!

I have created a short little script in order to scrape https://myanimelist.net/topanime.php?limit=0 and create a table of the top 50 anime.
So far, this is only the first page, but I plan to scale this up and get a table containing the top 500 anime, or even top 2,000 anime.

That is all! It's a little messy for now, but I am very proud of what I have made.
